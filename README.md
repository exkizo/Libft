# Libft
  This is my repository for the first project as a 42 studend. The goal here is to create a C library that will provide me with useful tools for future projects.


## Part 1 - Libc functions
  In this first part, you must re-code a set of the libc functions, as defined in their
man. Your functions will need to present the same prototype and behaviors as the originals. Your functions’ names must be prefixed by “ft_”. For instance strlen becomes
ft_strlen.
### #Include `<stdio.h>`
* [`ft_isascii`](Libft/ft_isascii.c)			- test for ASCII character.
