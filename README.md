# 42 Libft

<div><h3>This is my first project as a 42 student. The goal is to creat a C library that will help me in future projects.</h3></div>
<div>
  <h1>Part 1 - Libc functions</h1>
  <p>In this first part, you must re-code a set of the libc functions, as defined in their
man. Your functions will need to present the same prototype and behaviors as the originals. Your functions’ names must be prefixed by “ft_”. For instance strlen becomes
ft_strlen.</p>
